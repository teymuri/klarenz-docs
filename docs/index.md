[__Klarenz__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Barlow) is a highly minimalist (the entire API consists of a single class `Part` and a main processor function `proc`!) and Pythonic package for compiling Lilypond sheet music.

Klarenz requires Python 3.5 or later:

```
~$ python --version
Python 3.10.12
```

Klarenz requires LilyPond 2.21.0 or later.
Make sure LilyPond is installed: http://lilypond.org/development.html
Make sure LilyPond is callable from the commandline:

```
~$ lilypond --version
GNU LilyPond 2.22.2
```

Klarenz is on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/klarenz/), so simply use pip to install it:

```
~$ python -m pip install klarenz
```

Start Python, import Klarenz and print some notes:


```
from klarenz import *
proc(Part({"pchs": range(60, 72), "onsets": range(12)}))
```

If you want to use two instruments instead of just one, simply pass a list of parts to the processor function proc, rather than just one part:
```
proc(
    [
        Part({"pchs": range(72, 84), "onsets": range(12)}),
        Part({"pchs": range(67, 79), "onsets": range(12)})
    ]
)
```

To have more than one voice in each part, pack multiple pitch and onset collections in a list:
```
proc(
    [
        Part({"pchs": [range(72, 84), range(65, 77)], "onsets": [range(12)] * 2}),
        Part({"pchs": [range(60, 72), range(67, 79)], "onsets": [range(12)] * 2})
    ]
)
```

Simple and pythonic!
